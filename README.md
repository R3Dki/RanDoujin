# RanDoujin
Random Doujinshi Code Generator made in C++.
It only uses the standard library which means it's capable of running on (almost) any device.
## Not much can be said...
### It should be basically self explainatory

# g++ -o RanDoujin RanDoujin.cpp<br>and you should be good to go.

# If you don't know what a doujinshi is don't look it up, just don't, trust me.
# This codes are really (not predetermined) random, so a code might lead you to nothing, something or some REALLY bad content that you may want to avoid...
